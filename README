 *  FuzzyMatch.apply is a method for comparing 2 names, that uses Levenshtein algorithm.
 *  The Levenshtein algorithm (also called Edit-Distance) calculates the
 *  least number of edit operations that are necessary to modify one string to obtain another string.
 *
 *  Method FuzzyMatch.apply returns 0 to 1 correlation between 2 names.
 *
 *  Names, that are used for fuzzy matching previously are:
 *
 *  1. Transliterated
